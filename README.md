# TGrad2C

## Goal of repo: Export Neural Netowrk to C

- [x] Train Simple Neural Network -> done with ```clean_train.ipynb```
- [x] Export C code -> done with  ```compile.py```
- [x] Compile witrh gcc -> done in ```clean_train.ipynb```
- [ ] Validate Compiled model. -> done in ```clean_train.ipynb```

## Current state

The weights generated during export to C do not match the python weights.
